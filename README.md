## personal learning.

Being the first time learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript there definately has been a huge learning curve in the way the systax and semantics play in each language. This is specially so for Javascript as its the language we have spend less time with and it looks like it loves using a lot of brackets. Over all, this is just the good balance of being given information and having to find stuff on your own.
